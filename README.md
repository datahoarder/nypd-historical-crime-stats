# Compiling NYPD stats

Just discovered that the NYPD [publishes historical precinct-level annual crime data as spreadsheets](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/analysis_and_planning/historical_nyc_crime_data.shtml).

The 2000 to 2014 Excel spreadsheets can be found at these direct links:

- [Citywide Seven Major Felony Offenses by Precinct 2000 - 2014](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/excel/analysis_and_planning/seven_major_felony_offenses_by_precinct_2000_2014.xls)
- [Non Seven Major Felony Offenses by Precinct 2000 - 2014](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/excel/analysis_and_planning/non_seven_major_felony_offenses_by_precinct_2000_2014.xls)
- [Misdemeanor Offenses by Precinct 2000 - 2014](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/excel/analysis_and_planning/misdemeanor_offenses_by_precinct_2000_2014.xls)
- [Violation Offenses by Precinct 2000 - 2014](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/excel/analysis_and_planning/violation_offenses_by_precinct_2000_2014.xls)



## History of NYPD crime stats

In the past, the NYPD has published PDF reports, which are substantially more difficult to parse. Before 2014, most [reports were only at the citywide level](https://web.archive.org/web/20130724044422/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/analysis_and_planning/historical_nyc_crime_data.shtml).

### Caveats

Open the spreadsheets for yourself to see the notes at the bottom. The most important caveats relate to precinct boundary changes, which would invalidate year-over-year comparisons for the affected precincts.

Here are the caveats verbatim:

- On Sept. 28, 2012, there was a re-alignment of the boundaries of the 077, 078, and 088 precincts.  Therefore statistics for the 077, 078, and 088 precincts following 2011 are not comparable to earlier years.
- The 121 pct was created on 7-1-2013 from parts of the 120 and 122 precinct.  Therefore statistics for 120 and 122 precincts following 2012 are not comparable to earlier years.

Here's a table listing the changes by precinct:

| Precinct | 2012 | 2013 |
|----------|------|------|
|       77 | X    |      |
|       78 | X    |      |
|       88 | X    |      |
|      120 |      | X    |
|      121 |      | X    |
|      122 |      | X    |
